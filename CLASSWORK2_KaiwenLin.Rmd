1.
A function is a block of code which runs by passing input and return output. A function accomplishes a specific task. A function are applied when a sequence of code needs to be used repeatedly, which not only makes the code more concise and neat to understand, but it also reduces the probability of mistakes on repeated codes.

```{r}
z_score <- function(x, mean, std) {
  (x-mean)/std
}

z_score(25.77, 23.54, 2.442)
```

3.
```{r}
log_prime <- function(x, prime_num) {
  round(log(x)*log10(x)/prime_num^(1/3), digits = 2)
}

log_prime(32, 11)
```

4.
```{r}
output <- vector('double', ncol(mtcars))
for (i in seq_along(mtcars)) {
  output[[i]] <- sd(mtcars[[i]])
}
